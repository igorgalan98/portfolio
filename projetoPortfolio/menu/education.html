        <p>As someone who has persistently sought knowledge throughout the years, my life has been characterized by
            a continuous pursuit of personal and intellectual development.</p>
        <p>During my childhood, I attended a state school called <em>Georgina de Oliveira Rocha. Aparecida do taboado, MS</em>.</p>
        <p>Since a child, I always dreamed of knowing how to speak English, so I taught myself by answering
            the English book in the first month every time a new year begins and looking into musics lyrics translations.</p>
        <p>I got a block trying to find something that I loved so I could keep
            studying, that was when I found <a href="https://ebaconline.com.br/" target="_blank">EBAC</a> (British School of Creative Arts and Technology).</p>

        <h2>Software Testing</h2>

        <p>As a student at EBAC, I completed a program in software testing with the aim of assuming the role of a Quality Assurance (QA) professional in the future.</p>
        <p>Throughout this course, I gained exposure to various testing tools and methodologies, including web testing, API testing, Android testing, automation, Gherkin language, JMeter for CSV file testing, Jenkinsfile for continuous integration, and agile methodology.</p>
        <p>I firmly believe that my acquired knowledge aligns with the qualifications sought by many companies
            for a Junior QA position. I am always eager to share my expertise and remain open to learning new
            approaches that may be unfamiliar to me.</p>

        <h2>College</h2>

        <p>I am currently enrolled in the first semester at the <em>Prof. Jos√© Camargo College of Technology</em> (<a href="https://www.fatecjales.edu.br/" target="_blank">FATEC</a>), Jales, SP.</p>
        <p>Here, I have had the opportunity to interact with distinguished professionals as depicted in the photos above.
            They have introduced me to a new realm encompassing not only technology but also languages, design, mathematics,
            and web content.</p>
        <p>The support and encouragement I have received from the outset have been instrumental in helping me discover
            fascinating topics that I am passionate about and intend to pursue throughout my life.</p>
